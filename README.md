## How It Works

The code utilizes the KPL Swing Indicator and the Trade library in MQL5 to execute trades. Here is a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

1. Include necessary header files: The code includes the required header files for the Trade library and the KPL Swing Indicator.

2. Initialize the Expert Advisor: The OnInit() function is called when the Expert Advisor is initialized. It sets the ExpertSignalIndications to the default value.

3. Deinitialize the Expert Advisor: The OnDeinit() function is called when the Expert Advisor is deinitialized. It removes the Expert Advisor.

4. OnTick() function: This function is executed on each tick. It checks for new swing highs or swing lows using the kplSwing.NewSwingHigh() and kplSwing.NewSwingLow() functions.

5. Close existing position: If there is an open position, the code closes the existing position using the trade.PositionClose() function.

6. Get the current swing direction: The code retrieves the current swing direction using the kplSwing.GetCurrentSwingDirection() function.

7. Open new position: Based on the current swing direction, the code opens a new position using the trade.Buy() or trade.Sell() functions. It calculates the entry price and stoploss price based on the current market prices and the predefined stopLoss value.

8. OnTrade() function: This function is executed on each tick during an open position. It checks if there is an open position using the trade.PositionSelect() function.

9. Set trailing stoploss: If the position is profitable, the code sets a trailing stoploss using the trade.PositionModify() function. It calculates the trailing stoploss price based on the entry price and the predefined trailingStopLoss value.

10. Other trade-related functions: The code includes additional trade-related functions that are not used in this particular trading strategy.

Please note that the code provided is a simplified version to demonstrate the basic logic of the KPL Swing Indicator trading strategy. It may require further customization and optimization to suit specific trading needs.
